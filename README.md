## Environment Variables

If you want to run this project on your own, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`REACT_API_KEY`


## Features

- Recipe search either by name or ingredients
- When searching by name, you can filter results to show only vegan, vegetarian or gluten free recipes.
- You can view the general details of each recipe, which includes the ingredients and the instructions to prepare it.


## Limitations

- The amount of results per search is limited to 100 per the Spoonacular API (the app results are limited to 50 but it can be modified).
- The demo version uses a trial plan for the Spoonacular API so there is a daily quota to perform searches and see recipe details. Considering an "action" to be searching and looking at a specific recipe details, the quota would allow around 120 actions per day.
